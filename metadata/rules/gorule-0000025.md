Given an annotation to a general term plus annotation extensions we can infer a more specific annotation.

For example, given a source annotation:

```
Gene = geneA
Annotation_class = GO:0006260 ! DNA replication
Annotation_extension = {occurs_in GO:0000262 ! mitochondrial chromosome}
```

This will be inferred:

```
Gene = geneA
Annotation_class = GO:0006264 ! mitochondrial DNA replication
Annotation_extension = {occurs_in GO:0000262 ! mitochondrial chromosome}
Evidence: IC
With: GO:0006260
```

Approach is described in more detail here: https://github.com/owlcollab/owltools/wiki/Annotation-Extension-Folding

Fields:

 * GO ID: new inferred, more specific GO ID
 * Evidence: IC
 * With: original GO ID
 * Assigned-by: GOC-OWL
 
Other fields remain the same
