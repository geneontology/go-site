title: "Annotations using ISS/ISA/ISO evidence should refer to a gene product (in the 'with' column)" 
type: report
fail_mode: soft

If evidence (GAF column 7; GPAD column 6) is one of ISS, ISA, ISO, then there must be a value in the 'with/from' field (GAF column 8; GPAD column 7). 
See also GO-RULE:0000038 (proposed) for a check of the values in the 'with' field. 
Noting that ISM is not covered by this rule yet.

Exception: (not yet implemented at GO Central): objects of type 'ncRNA' (SO:0001263 and children) using ISM as evidence do not need data in the 'with' field.
