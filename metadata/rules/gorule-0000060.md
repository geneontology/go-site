GAF2.2 files require a gene product to term relation in Column 4. Allowed relations:  

* For `GO:0005554 molecular function` and subclass descendants: 
    * The allowed relations are `RO:0002327 "enables"` and `RO_0002326 "contributes_to"`.
* For `GO:0008150 biological process`:
    * If the annotation is to the root term `GO:0008150 biological process`, then the allowed relation is `"involved_in"`.
    * The allowed relations are `RO:0002331 "involved_in"`, `RO:0002264 "acts upstream or within"`.
* For `GO:0008372 cellular component`
    * If the annotation is to the root term `cellular_component`, then the allowed relation is `RO:0002432 "is_active_in"`.
    * If the annotation is to `"GO:0032991 "protein-containing complex"` or a subclass descendant of, then the allowed relation is `"BFO:0000050 "part of"`.
    * Else, the allowed relations are `RO:0001025 "located in"` and `RO:0002432 "is_active_in"`.

* For `GO:0005554 molecular function` and subclass descendants: 
    * the relation is `RO:0002327 "enables"`. 
* For `GO:0008150 biological process`:
    * If the annotation is to the root term `biological process`, then the relation is `RO:0002331 "involved_in"`.
    * If the annotation is to is a subclass descendant of `GO:0008150 biological process` then the allowed relations are `RO:0002331 "involved_in"`, 
    `RO:0002264 "acts upstream or within"`, `RO:0004032 acts upstream of or within, positive effect`, `RO:0004033 acts upstream of or within, negative effect`, 
    `RO:0002263 acts upstream of`, `RO:0004034 acts upstream of, positive effect`, `RO:0004035 acts upstream of, negative effect`
* For `GO:0008372 cellular component` 
    * If the annotation is to the root term `cellular_component`, then the relation is `RO:0002432 "is_active_in"`.
    * If the annotation is to `"GO:0032991 "protein-containing complex"` or a subclass descendant of, then the relation is `"BFO:0000050 "part of"`
    * Else, the relation is `RO:0001025 "located in"`.
