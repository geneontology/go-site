For background: dual species annotations are used to capture information about
multi-organism interactions. The first taxon ID should be that of the
species encoding the gene product, and the second should be the taxon of
the other species in the interaction. Where the interaction is between
organisms of the same species, both taxon IDs should be the same.

This rule should check that these annotations should be used only in conjunction with
terms that have the biological process term 'GO:0044419 : interspecies interaction
between organisms', the process GO:0043903 regulation of interspecies interactions between organisms, or the cellular component term 'GO:0018995 : host cellular component' as an ancestor.
