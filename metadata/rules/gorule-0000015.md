For background: dual (or multiple) species annotations are used to capture information about multi-species interactions. The first taxon ID should be that of the species encoding the gene product annotated, and the second (and further) IDs should be the taxon of the other species in the interaction. 

* Each value in the Taxon column (GAF column 13) should be unique. 

This rule applies to annotations to either these terms of their is_a descendants: 
* GO:0044419 biological process involved in interspecies interaction between organisms
* GO:0043903 regulation of interspecies interactions between organisms, or
* GO:0018995 host cellular component

* Annotations to other terms should have a single value in the Taxon column (GAF column 13).
