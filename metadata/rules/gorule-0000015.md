Dual species annotations are used to capture information about
multi-organism interactions. The first taxon ID should be that of the
species encoding the gene product, and the second should be the taxon of
the other species in the interaction. Where the interaction is between
organisms of the same species, both taxon IDs should be the same. These
annotations should be used only in conjunction with terms that have the
biological process term 'GO:0044419 : interspecies interaction between organisms' or the
cellular component term 'GO:0044215 : other organism' as an ancestor.
