The IEP and its high throughput equivalent, HEP, evidence codes are used where process involvement is inferred from
the timing or location of expression of a gene, particularly when comparing a gene that is not yet characterized with the timing or
location of expression of genes known to be involved in a particular process. This type of annotation is only suitable with terms from the
Biological Process ontology. However since annotations inferred from interontology links keep the same evidence code, an exception needs to be made for annotations assigned by GOC.
