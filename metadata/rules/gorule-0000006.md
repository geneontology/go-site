The IEP and its high throughput equivalent, HEP, evidence codes are used where process involvement is inferred from
the timing or location of expression of a gene, particularly when
comparing a gene that is not yet characterized with the timing or
location of expression of genes known to be involved in a particular
process. This type of annotation is only suitable with terms from the
Biological Process ontology, except when the annotation comes from 
an inter ontology link, in which case all GO aspects are allowed.

guidelines](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines)
