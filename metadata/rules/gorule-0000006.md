The IEP and its high throughput equivalent, HEP, evidence codes are used where process involvement is inferred from
the timing or location of expression of a gene, particularly when
comparing a gene that is not yet characterized with the timing or
location of expression of genes known to be involved in a particular
process. This type of annotation is only suitable with terms from the
Biological Process ontology.
