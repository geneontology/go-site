All IC annotations (GAF column 7; GPAD1.1 Column 6) should include a GO ID in the "With/From" column (GAF column 8; GPAD1.2 Column 7); that ID cannot be the same as the GO term annotated in GAF column 5 (GPAD1.2 column 4). For more information, see the [IC evidence code
guidelines](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Inferred_by_Curator_(IC)).
