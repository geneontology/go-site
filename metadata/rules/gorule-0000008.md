Some terms are too high-level to provide useful information when used
for annotation, regardless of the evidence code used.

We provide and maintain the list of too high-level terms as two subsets
in the ontology:

-   gocheck\_do\_not\_annotate "Term not to be used for direct
    annotation"
-   gocheck\_do\_not\_manually\_annotate "Term not to be used for direct
    manual annotation"

Both subsets denote high level terms, not to be used for any manual
annotation.

For inferred electronic annotations (IEAs), we allow the use of terms
from the gocheck\_do\_not\_manually\_annotate subset. These terms may
still offer some general information, but a human curator should always
be able to find a more specific annotation.
