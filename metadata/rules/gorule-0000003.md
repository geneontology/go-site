Annotations to binding : GO:0005488 or protein binding ; GO:0005515 with
the TAS, NAS, IC, IMP, IGI and IDA evidence codes are not informative as
they do not allow the interacting partner to be specified. If the nature
of the binding partner is known (protein or DNA for example), an
appropriate child term of binding ; GO:0005488 should be chosen for the
annotation. In the case of chemicals, ChEBI IDs can go in the 'with'
column. Children of protein binding ; GO:0005515 where the type of
protein is identified in the GO term name do not need further
specification.

For more information, see the [binding
guidelines](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines)
on the GO wiki.
