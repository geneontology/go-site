Rules are in the `extensions-constraints.yaml` file (https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/extensions-constraints.yaml). This is
a list of allowed extension Relation, Filler (the ID inside the parentheses), and
the acceptable GO Term roots used with this relation. A cardinality constraint may also be
applied.

Extensions in annotations should conform to these constraints. If an element of a
disjunction in the extensions does not follow one of the constraints as listed in
the above file, that element should be dropped from the extensions.

Note that in the GO Central pipeline, this is only implmented upon imports of external annotations into Noctua.
