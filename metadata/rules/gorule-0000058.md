In the go-site/metadata directory there is a file `extensions-constraints.yaml`. This is
a list of allowed extension Relation, Filler (the ID inside the parentheses), and
the acceptable GO Term roots used with this relation. A cardinality constraint may also be
applied.

Extensions in annotations should conform to these constraints. If an element of a
disjunction in the extensions does not follow one of the constraints as listed in
the above file, that element should be dropped from the extensions.
