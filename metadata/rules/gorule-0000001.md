Each line of a GAF file is checked that it generally conforms to the GAF 2.1 spec and some
GO specific specifications. The GAF 2.1 spec is here: http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-gaf-format-21.

Qualifier, evidence, aspect and DB object columns must be within the list of allowed values
(as per the spec).
