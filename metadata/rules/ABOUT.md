# GO Rules

This folder contains the metadata for all annotation and ontology QC
rules in GO. Each rule has an identifier, metadata and
descriptions. Some rules are automatable, in which case the metadata
contains the information required to execute it.

For more details for GOC members on how to create rules, see [SOP.md](SOP.md)
