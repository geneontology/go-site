If an annotation has GO_REF:0000118 (GAF column 6, GPAD column 5) and the taxon (GAF column 13, GPI column 7) is present in the GO reference species list (i.e 143 Panther species; [go-reference-species.yaml](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/go-reference-species.yaml)), then the annotation should be filter out. Note that this is not a line-by-line check in GPAD since it required both the GPAD and the GPI files.
