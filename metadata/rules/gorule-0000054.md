Use of the ND evidence code specifically indicates that a curator has looked but not been able to find information that supports making an annotation to any term from the Molecular Function, Biological Process, or Cellular Component as of the annotation date indicated.

Note that use of the ND evidence code with an annotation to one of the root nodes to indicate lack of knowledge in that aspect makes a statement about the lack of knowledge only with respect to that particular aspect of the ontology. Use of the ND evidence code to indicate lack of knowledge in one particular aspect does not make any statement about the availability of knowledge or evidence in the other GO aspects.
