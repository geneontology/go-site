There should be no annotations to obsolete terms or to an alternate ID. Obsolete terms that have a `replace_by` tag and
terms annotated to one of their alternative IDs (merged terms) will automatically be repaired to the valid term id.
If no replacement is found, the annotation will be filtered.

Other GO terms present in annotations (with/from column, etc) also should be repaired if possible.
