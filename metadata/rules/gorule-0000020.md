Ontology operations such as term merges and obsoletions may be out of
sync with annotation releases. Each GO entry T in the GAF is checked to
see if it corresponds to a valid (non-obsolete) term in the ontology. If
not, metadata for other terms is checked. If the term has been merged
into a term S (i.e. S has alt\_id of T) then T is replaced by S in the
GAF line.
