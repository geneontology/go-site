The [No Data (ND) evidence code](http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#nd) should be used
for annotations to the root terms and only to the root terms. Inversely, annotations to the root terms can only use ND evidence codes.

Error report (number of errors) in [db_species]-report.html & owltools-check.txt (details).
