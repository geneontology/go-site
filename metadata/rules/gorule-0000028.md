Aspect (Column 9) can be one either C, P, or F. These correspond to the three main
branches of the Gene Ontology: C for Cellular Component, P for Biological Process,
F for Molecular Function. These can be computed from the GO Term in the GAF
annotation. If the Aspect is incorrect issue a warning and replace with the
corrected aspect.
