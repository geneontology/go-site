Annotations representing self-binding mean that the gene product annotated interacts with itself. Therefore, the entity in the 'with/from' column (colomn 8) should be the same as the gene product (column 2). 

Self-binding terms include GO:0042803 protein homodimerization activity, GO:0051260 protein homooligomerization, 
GO:0051289 protein homotetramerization, GO:0070207 protein homotrimerization, GO:0043621 protein self-association, and GO:0032840 intramolecular proline-rich ligand binding (and their 'is_a' descendants).
