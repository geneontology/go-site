GAF2.2 files require a gene product to term relation in Column 4. Allowed relations:  
* For GO:0005554 molecular function and subclass descendants:
    * The relation is RO:0002327 "enables".
* For GO:0008150 biological process: 
    * If the annotation is to the root term biological process, then the relation is RO:0002331 "involved_in".
    * If the annotation is to is a subclass descendant of GO:0008150 biological process then the allowed relations are RO:0002331 "involved_in", RO:0002264 "acts upstream or within", RO:0004032 acts upstream of or within, positive effect, RO:0004033 acts upstream of or within, negative effect, RO:0002263 acts upstream of, RO:0004034 acts upstream of, positive effect, RO:0004035 acts upstream of, negative effect 
* For GO:0008372 cellular component
    * If the annotation is to the root term cellular_component, then the allowed relation is RO:0002432 "is_active_in".
    * If the annotation is to "GO:0032991 "protein-containing complex" or a subclass descendant of, then the allowed relation is "BFO:0000050 "part of".
    * Else, the allowed relations are RO:0001025 "located in" and RO:0002432 "is_active_in"RO_0002325 "colocalizes_with".
