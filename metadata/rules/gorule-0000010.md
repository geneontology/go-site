DEPRECATED: This has been subsumed by GORULE:0000027

References in the GAF (Column 6) should be of the format
db\_name:db\_key|PMID:12345678, e.g. SGD\_REF:S000047763|PMID:2676709.
No other format is acceptable for PubMed references; the following
examples are invalid:

-   PMID:PMID:14561399
-   PMID:unpublished
-   PMID:.
-   PMID:0

This is proposed as a HARD QC check: incorrectly formatted references
will be removed.
