For annotations by ISO, ISA or ISS, the annotations of the gene product (col 8 info in the GAF) should be checked to ensure that an annotation exists to the same or a more granular term. For instance:

Gene Product 1 | GO:1233456 |  ISS/ISO/ISA | with: Gene Product 2
Gene Product 2 | GO:1233456 (or a descentant) | EXP (or a descendant)

Allowed evidence codes for the primary annotations: EXP, IMP, IDA, IPI, IEP, IGI, HTP, HMP, HDA, HEP, HGI.
