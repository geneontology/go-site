GO should not include annotations to retracted publications (GAF column 6, GPAD column 5). 

PubMed keeps record of retracted publications in the PublicationTypeList of
each paper's XML entry. GOC manually download the data from [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/betaSearch?query=%28PUB_TYPE%3A%22Retracted%20Publication%22%29&page=1)
and save it on the [go-site/metadata folder](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/retracted-publications.txt).
