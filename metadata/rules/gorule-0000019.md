DEPRECATED: This is done outside of the rules system. Ontobio performs
a GAF -> RDF translation as part of the pipeline.

The entire GAF is converted to OWL, combined with the main GO ontology
and auxhiliary constraint ontologies. The resulting ontology is checked
for consistency and unsatisfiable classes over using a complete DL
reasoner such as HermiT.
