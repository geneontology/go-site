Annotations will be propagated from MF to BP over part_of, or from BP to CC over occurs_in.

## Background

MF, BP and CC aspects of the GO can be regarded as branches or sub-hierarchies within a single ontology, cross-linked via a variety of relations. Therefore, annotations can be inferred from their relationships with terms from other aspects. 

## Procedure

 * Any asserted or inferred annotation to a MF, where MF part-of BP, will generate an `involved-in` to that BP
 * Asserted or inferred annotation to a BP using the `involved-in` relation, where BP occurs-in CC, will generate a `part-of` annotation to that CC


### Evidence and provenance

 * ECO (GAF2.2 Column 7/GAPD1.1 Column 6): IEA
 * "with/from" (GAF2.2 Column 8/GAPD1.1 Column 7): the GO term from which the anontation is propagated
 *  Reference: GO_REF:0000108 (https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/gorefs/goref-0000108.md)
 * Date (GAF2.2 Column 14/GAPD1.1 Column 9): the date the script was run
 * Assigned_by (GAF2.2 Column 15/GAPD1.1 Column 10): GOC

## TBD

* Should this pipeline filter annotations based on some redundancy criteria?
* goref-0000108.md mentions other evidence codes (not 3-letter); those should be fixed
