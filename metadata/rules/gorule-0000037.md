Only files coming from the https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/datasets/paint.yaml can use the IBA evidence code. 

If the evidence code is IBA, then (1) the assigned_by field must be GO_Central and (2) the reference field must be PMID:21873635.

Implementation: the GO Central pipeline should filter out IBAs from any submission source that is not a PAINT submission source, i.e. one registered in paint.yaml and having a name paint_X. Note that IBAs from PAINT will be injected in to the final release file for that organism.
