For annotations with the IBA evidence code, (1) the 'assigned_by' field (GAF column 15; GPAD column 10) must be GO_Central and (2) the 'reference' field (GAF column 6; GPAD column 5) must be GO_REF:0000033.

Implementation: the GO Central pipeline filters out IBAs from any submission source that is not in the PAINT submission source, i.e. one registered in [paint.yaml](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/datasets/paint.yaml). IBAs from PAINT are injected in to the final release files as part of the release process.
