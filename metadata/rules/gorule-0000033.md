IDs in the Reference (column 6) field will only be accepted if they are from PMID, PMC, doi, or GO_REF. Group specific References will no longer be accepted and will be filtered. For example, FB:FBrf0159398 is a synonym for GO_REF:0000015. So if the FB Reference is found, it will be removed, leaving GO_REF:0000015 instead. If an ID cannot be repaired/replaced then the GAF annotation will be filtered.

The list of GO_REFs are here: https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/tree/master/metadata/gorefs.
