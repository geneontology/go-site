IDs in the Reference field should only be only from PMID, PMC, doi, or GO_REF. Group specific References will be filtered if there is also an accepted public ID. For example, if FB:FBrf0159398 and GO_REF:0000015 are both found, the FB ID will be removed. If only the group ID exists, a warning will be issued.

The list of GO_REFs are here: https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/tree/master/metadata/gorefs.
