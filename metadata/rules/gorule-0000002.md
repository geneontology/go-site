No direct annotations to protein binding ; GO:0005515 can contain the qualifier 'NOT' in GAF 2.2 Column 4 or GPAD 2.0 Column 2.

Even if an identifier is available in the 'with' column, a qualifier
only informs on the GO term, it cannot instruct users to restrict the
annotation to just the protein identified in the 'with', therefore an
annotation applying protein binding ; GO:0005515 with the not qualifier
implies that the annotated protein cannot bind anything, which is unlikely to be correct.

This rule *only* applies to GO:0005515; children of this term can be
qualified with not, as further information on the type of binding is
then supplied in the GO term; e.g. not + NFAT4 protein binding ;
GO:0051529 would be fine, as the negative binding statement only applies
to the NFAT4 protein.

For more information, see the [binding
guidelines](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines)
on the GO wiki.
