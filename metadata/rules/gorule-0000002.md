An annotation to binding ; GO:0005488 or protein binding ; GO:0005515 with the 'not' qualifier implies that the annotated protein cannot bind anything. There are no characterized examples of a protein with no interactions.

The presence of an identifier in the 'with' column or in an annotation extension would not justify a 'not' annotation either, since a qualifier 
add precision to the GO term; it does not imply that a protein does not have the activity designated by the GO term under the specific context specified by the annotation extension. 

This rule *only* applies to direct annotations to GO:0005488  and GO:0005515; children of these terms can be
qualified with 'not', as further information on the type of binding is
then supplied in the GO term. For more information, see the [binding
guidelines](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines) on the GO wiki.
