Even if an identifier is available in the 'with' column, a qualifier
only informs on the GO term, it cannot instruct users to restrict the
annotation to just the protein identified in the 'with', therefore an
annotation applying protein binding ; GO:0005515 with the not qualifier
implies that the annotated protein cannot bind anything.

This is such a wide-reaching statement that few curators would want to
make.

This rule *only* applies to GO:0005515; children of this term can be
qualified with not, as further information on the type of binding is
then supplied in the GO term; e.g. not + NFAT4 protein binding ;
GO:0051529 would be fine, as the negative binding statement only applies
to the NFAT4 protein.

For more information, see the [binding
guidelines](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Binding_Guidelines)
on the GO wiki.
