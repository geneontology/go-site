In GAFs, relation is overloaded into qualifier.
If no explicit non-NOT qualifier is specified, use a default based on GPI specifications:
For Cellular Component: relation = 'part_of'
For Biological Process: relation = 'involved_in'
For Molecular Function: relation = 'enables'

##This seems to be only exported in GPAD for now.

##Now covered by GORULE-0000059 and GORULE-0000061. This was not being reported in rule reports as og 2024-07.
