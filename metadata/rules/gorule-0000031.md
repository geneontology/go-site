In GAFs, relation is overloaded into qualifier.
If no explicit non-NOT qualifier is specified, use a default based on GPI specifications:
For Cellular Component: relation = 'part_of'
For Biological Process: relation = 'involved_in'
For Molecular Function: relation = 'enables'

##This seems to be only exported in GPAD for now.
