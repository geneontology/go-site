-   Col 1 and all DB abbreviations must be in
    [db-xrefs.yaml](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/db-xrefs.yaml) (see below)
-   The `assigned_by` field is checked against [groups.yaml](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/groups.yaml)  
-   All GO IDs must be extant in current ontology

### Additional notes on identifiers

In some contexts an identifier is represented using two fields, for example col1 (prefix)
and col2 (local id) of a GAF or GPAD. The global id is formed by concatenating these with `:`.
In other contexts such as the "With/from" field, a global ID is specified, which MUST always be prefixed.

In all cases, the prefix MUST be in [db-xrefs.yaml](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/db-xrefs.yaml).
The prefix SHOULD be identical (case-sensitive match) to the `database` field.
If it does not match then it MUST be identical (case-sensitive) to one of the synonyms.

When consuming association files, programs SHOULD *repair* by replacing prefix synonyms
with the canonical form, in addition to reporting on the mismatch. For example, as part
of the association file release the submitted files should swap out legacy uses of 'UniProt' with 'UniProtKB'

### PubMed reference formatting must be correct
References in the GAF (Column 6) should be of the format db_name:db_key|PMID:12345678,
e.g. SGD_REF:S000047763|PMID:2676709. No other format is acceptable for PubMed references;
the following examples are invalid
-   PMID:PMID:14561399
-   PMID:unpublished
-   PMID:.
-   PMID:0
