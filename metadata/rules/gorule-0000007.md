The [IPI (Inferred from Physical Interaction) evidence
code](http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#ipi) is used where
an annotation can be supported from interaction evidence between the
gene product of interest and another molecule (see the [evidence code
documentation](http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml#ipi)).
While the IPI evidence code is frequently used to support annotations to
terms that are children of binding ; GO:0005488, it is thought unlikely
by the Binding working group that enough information can be obtained
from a binding interaction to support an annotation to a term that is a
chid of catalytic activity ; GO:0003824. Such IPI annotations to child
terms of catalytic activity ; GO:0003824 may need to be revisited and
corrected.

For more information, see the [catalytic activity annotation
guide](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Annotations_to_Catalytic_activity_with_IPI)
on the GO wiki.
