Few proteins are part of a process as well as regulate that process. We need to review the list of proteins having annotations to a term x and to regulation of that term. This report would look globally at all annotations from any source and look for co-annotation of a term 'x' and its regulation ('regulation of X').
As a second step we may create exception lists for cases known to be correct.
