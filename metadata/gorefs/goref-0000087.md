We have created a standard template for classes describing the protein localization and establishment of protein localization to a cellular component as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0008104 and 'has_target_end_location' some C" (protein localization) and "GO:0045184 and 'has_target_end_location' some C" (establishment of protein localization), where C is cellular component.
