##  TreeGrafter-generated GO annotations

TreeGrafter is a software tool for annotating protein sequences using pre-annotated PANTHER phylogenetic trees. TreeGrafter takes an input query protein sequence, finds the best matching homologous family, and then grafts it to the best location in the tree. It then annotates the query sequence by propagating annotations from the appropriate ancestral node(s) in the reference tree, which were manually annotated using the PAN-GO method (see GOREF_0000033). This method is integrated into InterProScan, which produces annotations to millions of genes across tens of thousands of organisms.
 
The full method is described in PMID:30032202.
