## Representation of plant formation as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the formation of a plant structure as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom template is "'anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis' and 'results in formation of' some P", where P is a plant anatomical entity (PO:0025131).
