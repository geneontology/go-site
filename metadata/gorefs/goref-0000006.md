## Gene Ontology annotation by the MGI curatorial staff, Mouse Locus Catalog

For annotations documented via this citation, curators used the information in the Mouse Locus Catalog in MGI to assign GO terms. The GO terms were assigned based on MLC textual descriptions of genes that could not be traced to the primary literature. Details of this strategy can be found in Hill et al, Genomics (2001) 74:121-128.
