## Gene Ontology annotations inferred by curators' judgment using experimental data and prior knowledge of apoptotic mechanisms.

This GO_REF is meant as a subtype of GO_REF:0000036, and its use is limited to annotation of gene products involved in apoptotic cell death. The Gene Ontology Consortium uses the IC (Inferred by Curator) evidence code when an annotation cannot be supported by any direct evidence, but can be inferred by GO annotations that have been annotated to the same gene/gene product identifier in conjunction with the curator's knowledge of biology (supporting GO annotations must not be IC-evidenced). In many cases an IC-evidenced annotation simply applies the same reference that was used in the supporting GO annotation. The use of IC evidence code in an annotation with reference GO_REF:0000057 signifies a curator inferred the GO term based on evidence from multiple sources of evidence/GO annotations. The 'with/from' field in these annotations will therefore supply more than one GO identifier, obtained from the set of supporting GO annotations assigned to the same gene/gene product identifier which cite publicly-available references. In inferring a specific apoptotic mechanism, the curator may refer to the following publications: PMID:21760595, PMID:19373242, PMID:21415859.
