## Gene Ontology annotation through association of InterPro records with GO terms, accompanied by conservative changes to GO terms applied by UniProt. 

Transitive assignment of GO terms based on InterPro classification. For any database entry (representing a protein or protein-coding gene) that has been annotated with one or more InterPro domains, The corresponding GO terms are obtained from a translation table of InterPro entries to GO terms (interpro2go) generated manually by the InterPro team at EBI. The mapping file is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/interpro2go.<br>Please note that the GO term in the annotation assigned with this GO reference has been changed from that originally applied by the InterPro2GO mapping. This change has been carried out by the UniProt group to ensure the GO annotation obeys the GO Consortiumâ€™s ontology structure and taxonomic constraints. Further information on the rules used by UniProt to transform specific incorrect IEA annotations is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/AnnotationPostProcessing.html.
