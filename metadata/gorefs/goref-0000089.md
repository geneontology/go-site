## Representation of single-organism and multi-organism biological processes in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the single-organism and multi-organism biological processes. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "P and 'bearer_of' some PATO:0002487" (single-organism) and "P and 'bearer_of' some PATO:0002486" (multi-organism), where P is a biological process.
