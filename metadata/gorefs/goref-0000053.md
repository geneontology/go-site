## Automatic classification of GO using the ELK reasoner

We use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elk-reasoner/">ELK reasoner</a> as part of an ontology development and release pipeline to automatically construct and check a large portion of the GO graph. The editors version of the GO (gene_ontology_write.obo) contains additional metadata, including provenance of graph links. Every week, the GO pipeline executes a process which first removes all links tagged as "is_inferred". The reasoner then generates a list of inferred links which are automatically added to the ontology with the "is_inferred" tag set. The pipeline generates a report describing which links have changed as a part of this process.
