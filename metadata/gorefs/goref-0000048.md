This describes TIGR curators' interpretation of a combination of evidence. Our internal software tools present us with a great deal of evidence based on domains, sequence similarities, signal sequences, paralogous proteins, etc. The curator interprets the body of evidence to make a decision about a GO assignment when an external reference is not available. The curator places one or more accessions that informed the decision in the "with" field.
