## OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation based on the manual assignment of UniProtKB Subcellular Location terms in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.

Transitive assignment of GO terms based on the UniProtKB Subcellular Location vocabulary. UniProtKB Subcellular Location is a controlled vocabulary used to supply subcellular location information to UniProtKB entries in the SUBCELLULAR LOCATION lines. Terms from this vocabulary are annotated manually to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. Further information on the UniProtKB manual annotation method is available at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45.<br>When a UniProtKB Subcellular Location term describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the term to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB Subcellular Location terms and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB Subcellular Location terms is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/spsl2go.
