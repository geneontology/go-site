##  Automated transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to mouse-human orthologs

The Alliance of Genome Resources (https://www.alliancegenome.org/) has procedures in place to establish orthology relationships 
between genes. The experimentally-based annotations (IDA, IMP IPI, IGI, and EXP) for human genes annotated by 
the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) Database are used to provide annotations to the respective mouse orthologs, 
and given the ISO evidence code and an entry in the inferred_from field to indicate the orthologous entity.
