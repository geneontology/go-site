## Gene Ontology annotation of transfer RNAs based on tRNAscan-SE analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster genome (2002).

Gene Ontology annotation based on predicted cytoplasmic tRNAs using tRNAscan-SE analysis (doi: 10.1093/nar/25.5.0955) of the Drosophila melanogaster genome (2002). Annotations have been reviewed by FlyBase (2015) and found to be consistent when compared with the most recent tRNAscan-SE analysis of the genome (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/genomes/eukaryota/Dmela6/).
