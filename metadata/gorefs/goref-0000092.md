## Representation for the biosynthesis from or via a chemical as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the biosynthesis of a chemical entity from or via an other chemical entity as biological processes. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0009058 and 'has output' some T and 'has input' some F" (biosynthesis from) and "GO:0009058 and 'has output' some T and 'has intermediate' some I" (biosynthesis via), where T,F, and I are chemical entities (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
