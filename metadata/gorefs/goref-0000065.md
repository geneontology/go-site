title: Representation of transport of a chemical entity as a biological process in the Gene Ontology
year: 2013
---

We have created a standard template for classes describing transport of a chemical entity (ChEBI) as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom template is "GO:0006810 and 'transports or maintains localization of' some X", where X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
