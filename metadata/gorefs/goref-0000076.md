## Representation of transport or vesicle-mediated transport from cell component to cell component as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the transport or vesicle-mediated transport from cellular component to cellular component as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0006810 and 'has_target_start_location' some F and 'has_target_end_location' some T" (transport) and "GO:0016192 and 'has_target_start_location' some F and 'has_target_end_location' some T" (vesicle-mediated transport), where F and T are a cellular components.
