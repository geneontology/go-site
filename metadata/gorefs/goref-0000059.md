We have created a standard template for the definition of classes for the regulation of a molecular function. This includes the definitions for positive and negative regulation. The equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0065007 and 'regulates' some X" (regulation), "GO:0065007 and 'negatively_regulates' some X" (negative regulation), and "GO:0065007 and 'positively_regulates' some X" (positive regulation), where X is a molecular function.
