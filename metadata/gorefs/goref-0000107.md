## Automatic transfer of experimentally verified manual GO annotation data to orthologs using Ensembl.

GO terms from a source species are projected onto one or more target species based on gene orthology obtained from Ensembl. One to one, one to many and many to many orthologies are used but annotations are only projected between orthologs that have at least a 40% peptide identity to each other. Only GO annotations with evidence codes ECO:0000314 (IDA), ECO:0000270 (IEP), ECO:0000316 (IGI), ECO:0000315 (IMP), and ECO:0000353 (IPI), or their descendants, are projected; annotations with a 'NOT' qualifier are not projected, and neither are annotations to GO:0005515 (protein binding). Annotations that are projected using this technique receive the evidence code ECO:0000265 (sequence orthology evidence used in automatic assertion), which maps up to the GO Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA) evidence code.  The model organism database identifier of the annotation source will be indicated in the 'With' column of the GOA association file.
