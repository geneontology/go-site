## Gene Ontology annotations Inferred by Curator (IC) using at least one Inferred by Sequence Similarity (ISS) annotation to support the inference

The Gene Ontology Consortium uses the IC (Inferred by Curator) evidence code when assignment of a GO term cannot be supported by direct experimental or sequence-based evidence, but can, based on a curatorâ€™s biological knowledge, be reasonably inferred from existing GO annotations to the same gene/gene product.  Use of the IC evidence code with GO_REF:0000109 indicates that a curator inferred the GO term based on at least one supporting annotation with an 'Inferred from Sequence Similarity' (ISS) evidence code.  Note that additional supporting annotations may be experimentally evidenced. When using GO_REF:0000111, the 'with/from' field must contain all GO identifiers used as supporting annotations.
