## Representation of transport of a chemical entity as molecular function in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the transport of a chemical entity (ChEBI) as a molecular function. The underlying equivalence axiom template is "GO:0005215 and 'transports or maintains localization of' some X", where X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
