title: Representation of response to and cellular response to a chemical as biological process in the Gene Ontology
year: 2013
---

We have created a standard template for classes describing the response to and cellular response to a chemical entity (ChEBI) as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0050896 and 'has input' some X" (response to) and "GO:0070887 and 'has input' some X" (cellular response to), where X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
