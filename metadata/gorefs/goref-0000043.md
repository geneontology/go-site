## Gene Ontology annotation based on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot keyword mapping, accompanied by conservative changes to GO terms applied by UniProt.

Transitive assignments using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot keywords. The UniProtKB keyword controlled vocabulary has been created and used by the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) to supply 10 different categories of information to UniProtKB entries. Further information on the UniProtKB keyword resource can be found at http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist.<br>UniProtKB keywords are assigned to UniProtKB/UniProtKB entries by UniProt curators as part of the UniProtKB manual curation process. In contrast however, UniProtKB keywords are automatically assigned to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation program.<br>Further information on the two different UniProt annotation methods is available at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45 and http://www.uniprot.org/program/automatic_annotation.<br>When a UniProtKB keyword describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the keyword to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB keywords and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB keywords is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/uniprotkb_kw2go.<br>Please note that the GO term in the annotation assigned with this GO reference has been changed from that originally applied by the UniProtKB keywords 2GO mapping. This change has been carried out by the UniProt group to ensure the GO annotation obeys the GO Consortiumâ€™s ontology structure and taxonomic constraints. Further information on the rules used by UniProt to transform specific incorrect IEA annotations is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/AnnotationPostProcessing.html.
