## Automatic creation of relationships between ontology branches in the Gene Ontology

We have created a rule-based approach to create relations between the branches of the Gene Ontology. The approach uses the equivalence axioms and a given pattern to create non-subClassOf relationships between the three different branches of the Gene Ontology (biological process, molecular function, cellular component). Currently, there are the following rules: "'transporter activity' and 'transports_or_maintains_localization_of' some X' -part_of-> "transport and 'transports_or_maintains_localization_of' some X"; "'transmembrane transporter activity' and 'transports_or_maintains_localization_of' some X -part_of-> 'transmembrane transport' and 'transports_or_maintains_localization_of' some X"
