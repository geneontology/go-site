title: Representation of plant morphogenesis as biological process in the Gene Ontology
year: 2013
---

We have created a standard template for classes describing the morphogenesis of a plant structure as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom template is "'anatomical structure morphogenesis' and 'results in morphogenesis of' some P", where P is a plant anatomical entity (PO:0025131).
