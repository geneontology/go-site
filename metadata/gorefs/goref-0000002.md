## Gene Ontology annotation through association of InterPro records with GO terms.

Transitive assignment of GO terms based on InterPro classification. For any database entry (representing a protein or protein-coding gene) that has been annotated with one or more InterPro domains, The corresponding GO terms are obtained from a translation table of InterPro entries to GO terms (interpro2go) generated manually by the InterPro team at EBI. The mapping file is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/interpro2go.

## Comments

Formerly GOA:interpro. Note that GO annotations based on InterPro-to-GO transitive assignment may undergo subsequent filtering, e.g. to remove annotations redundant with manual curation; consult documentation from the annotation providers for further information.
