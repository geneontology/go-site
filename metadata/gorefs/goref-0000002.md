## Gene Ontology annotation through association of InterPro records with GO terms.

Transitive assignment of GO terms based on InterPro classification. For any database entry (representing a protein or protein-coding gene) that has been annotated with one or more InterPro domains, the corresponding GO terms are obtained from a translation table of InterPro entries to GO terms (interpro2go) generated manually by the InterPro team at EBI. The mapping file is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/interpro2go.

## Comments

Note that some groups filter GO annotations based on InterPro-to-GO transitive assignment, e.g. to remove annotations redundant with manual curation.
