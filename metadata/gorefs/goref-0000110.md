## Gene Ontology annotation of Drosophila melanogaster nuclear genes encoding proteins targeted to the mitochondrion.

Gene Ontology annotation of Drosophila melanogaster nuclear genes encoding proteins targeted to the mitochondrion based on analysis by MitoDrome (http://mitodrome.ba.itb.cnr.it/) by comparison of human mitochondrial proteins available in SWISSPROT vs. the Drosophila genome, ESTs and cDNA sequences available in the FlyBase database (PMID:12520013).
