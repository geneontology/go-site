Transitive assignment of GO terms based on InterPro classification. For any database entry (representing a protein or protein-coding gene) that has been annotated with one or more InterPro domains, the corresponding GO terms are obtained from a translation table of InterPro entries to GO terms (interpro2go) generated manually by the InterPro team at EBI. The mapping file is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/interpro2go.

## Comments

Note that some groups filter GO annotations based on InterPro-to-GO transitive assignment, e.g. to remove annotations redundant with manual curation.

Transitive assignment using Enzyme Commission identifiers. This method is used for any database entry, such as a protein record in UniProtKB or TrEMBL, that has had an Enzyme Commission number assigned. The corresponding GO term is determined using the EC cross-references in the GO molecular function ontology. Also see Hill et al., Genomics (2001) 74:121-128. The mapping file is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/ec2go.

Transitive assignments using UniProtKB keywords. The UniProtKB keyword controlled vocabulary has been created and used by the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) to supply 10 different categories of information to UniProtKB entries. Further information on the UniProtKB keyword resource can be found at http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist. <br>Further information on the UniProt annotation methods is available at  https://www.uniprot.org/help/manual_curation and https://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic_annotation.
<br>When a UniProtKB keyword describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the keyword to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB keywords and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB keywords is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/uniprotkb_kw2go.

## OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation by the MGI curatorial staff, Mouse Locus Catalog

For annotations documented via this citation, curators used the information in the Mouse Locus Catalog in MGI to assign GO terms. The GO terms were assigned based on MLC textual descriptions of genes that could not be traced to the primary literature. Details of this strategy can be found in Hill et al, Genomics (2001) 74:121-128.

## Gene Ontology annotation by the MGI curatorial staff, curated orthology

The sequence conservation that permits the establishment of orthology between mouse and rat or mouse and human genes is a strong predictor of the conservation of function for the gene product across these species. Therefore, in instances where a mouse gene product has not been functionally characterized, but its human or rat orthologs have, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) curators append the GO terms associated with the orthologous gene(s) to the mouse gene. Only those GO terms assigned by experimental determination to the ortholog of the mouse gene will be adopted by MGI. GO terms that are assigned to the ortholog of the mouse gene computationally (i.e. IEA), will not be transferred to the mouse ortholog. The evidence code represented by this citation is Inferred by Sequence Orthology (ISO).

For annotations documented via this citation, curators designed queries based on their knowledge of mouse gene nomenclature to group genes that shared common molecular functions, biological processes or cellular components. GO annotations were assigned to these genes in groups. Details of this strategy can be found in Hill et al., Genomics (2001) 74:121-128.

## Hidden Markov Models (TIGR)

 * id: [GO_REF:0000011](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/gorefs/goref-0000011.md)
 * year: 2003

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical representation of patterns found in a data set. When using HMMs with proteins, the HMM is a statistical model of the patterns of the amino acids found in a multiple alignment of a set of proteins called the "seed". Seed proteins are chosen based on sequence similarity to each other. Seed members can be chosen with different levels of relationship to each other. They can be members of a superfamily (ex. ABC transporter, ATP-binding proteins), they can all share the same exact specific function (ex. biotin synthase) or they could share another type of relationship of intermediate specificity (ex. subfamily, domain). New proteins can be scored against the model generated from the seed according to how closely the patterns of amino acids in the new proteins match those in the seed. There are two scores assigned to the HMM which allow annotators to judge how well any new protein scores to the model. Proteins scoring above the "trusted cutoff" score can be assumed to be part of the group defined by the seed. Proteins scoring below the "noise cutoff" score can be assumed to NOT be a part of the group. Proteins scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs may be part of the group but may not. One of the important features of HMMs is that they are built from a multiple alignment of protein sequences, not a pairwise alignment. This is significant, since shared similarity between many proteins is much more likely to indicate shared functional relationship than sequence similarity between just two proteins. The usefulness of an HMM is directly related to the amount of care that is taken in chosing the seed members, building a good multiple alignment of the seed members, assessing the level of specificity of the model, and choosing the cutoff scores correctly. In order to properly assess what functional relevance an above-trusted scoring HMM match has to a query, one must carefully determine what the functional scope of the HMM is. If the HMM models proteins that all share the same function then it is likely possible to assign a specific function to high-scoring match proteins based on the HMM. If the HMM models proteins that have a wide variety of functions, then it will not be possible to assign a specific function to the query based on the HMM match, however, depending on the nature of the HMM in question, it may be possible to assign a more general (family or subfamily level) function. In order to determine the functional scope of an HMM, one must carefully read the documentation associated with the HMM. The annotator must also consider whether the function attributed to the proteins in the HMM makes sense for the query based on what is known about the organism in which the query protein resides and in light of any other information that might be available about the query protein. After carefully considering all of these issues the annotator makes an annotation.

## Pairwise alignment (TIGR)

 * id: [GO_REF:0000012](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/gorefs/goref-0000012.md)
 * year: 2003
 * authors: Michelle Gwinn, TIGR curators



Pairwise alignments are generated by taking two sequences and aligning them so that the maximum number of amino acids in each protein match, or are similar to, each other. Tools such as BLAST work by comparing a protein-of-interest individually with every protein in a database of known protein sequences and retaining only those matches with a high probability of being significant. Basic BLAST generates local alignments between proteins for regions of high similarity. Other pairwise alignment tools attempt to generate global (full-length) protein alignments. A tool called Blast_Extend_repraze (BER, http://ber.sourceforge.net) has some benefits over basic BLAST. Input into the BER tool includes the underlying DNA sequence for each protein as well as 300 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted boundaries of the protein coding sequence. This allows annotators to see the DNA sequence that underlies the query protein as part of the alignment. In addition, the BER tool is able to look for continuation of regions of similarity through frameshifts and in-frame stop codons.  If such regions are found the alignment is continued. BER searches are done in a two-step process: step one is a BLAST search against a non-redundant protein database, significant BLAST hits are stored in a mini-database for each query protein; step two is a modified Smith-Waterman alignment between the query and the proteins in its mini-database. In order to assess whether a given BER alignment is good enough to assert that the query shares the function of the match protein, one must look at a several factors. First of all, the match protein must itself be experimentally characterized in order to avoid transitive annotation errors. In addition, any residues or secondary structures known to be important for function in the match protein must be conserved in the query. The alignment should be visually inspected to look for any areas of lesser quality that might indicate the two proteins do not share the same function. Although it is impossible to set cutoff values for percent identity and length of match that will apply for every alignment, there are some guidelines. In general at least 40% identity that extends over the full lengths of both proteins is required in order to even consider functional equivalence. However, this percentage is highly dependent on the length and complexity of the proteins. 40% identity between two proteins 500 amino acids long is much more significant that 40% identity between two proteins that are only 100 amino acids long. Therefore, the annotator's experience and knowledge of what is considered significant for the organism and protein family in question is very important. Some sets of proteins are much more highly conserved than others and therefore tolerances for percent identity may have to be adjusted. Finally, the alignment must be considered in the context of what else is known about the query protein and the organism as a whole.

Gene Ontology (GO) annotations with the evidence code 'Inferred from Electronic Annotation' (IEA) are assigned automatically to gene products in dictyBase. All Dictyostelium protein sequences are analyzed by BLAST against GO gene association sequence files, identifying proteins in other organisms that align with Dictyostelium proteins with an E value less than or equal to e-50. GO annotations that have been manually assigned to these proteins from other species are then imported and attached to the corresponding gene product in dictyBase. The proteins from which the annotations are derived are displayed in the 'Evidence' column on the Gene Ontology evidence and references page.

Current genetic and molecular studies in many model organisms are aimed at understanding formation and development of the nervous system. Up until this point, the GO has had a very shallow representation of processes pertaining to the nervous system. In June 2006, curators from MGI and ZFIN met with researchers studying central nervous system development to improve the representation of these processes in GO. In particular, emphasis was placed on three areas that are being addressed actively in current research: forebrain development, hindbrain development and neural tube development. This collaboration resulted in the addition of over 500 terms that reflect the development of the forebrain, the hindbrain, and the neural tube from the perspective of biological process and anatomical structure.

GO terms describing processes, functions, and cellular components related to the immune system have existed in the GO from its beginning and been used extensively in the annotation of gene products. However, particularly in the biological process ontology, the initial set of terms relating to immunology failed to cover the breadth of known immunological processes, and in many cases diverged from current usage and understanding in their names, definitions, and ontological placement. As part of a larger effort to improve the representation of immunology in the GO, a GO Content Meeting was held November 15-16, 2005, at The Institute for Genomic Research, to discuss improvements to representation of immunology in the biological process ontology of the GO. As a result of the meeting, a number of high level terms for immunological processes were created, an overall structure for immunologically related terms was established, and certain existing terms were renamed or redefined as well to bring them in line with current usage.

Transitive assignment of GO terms based on the UniProtKB Subcellular Location vocabulary. UniProtKB Subcellular Location is a controlled vocabulary used to supply subcellular location information to UniProtKB entries in the SUBCELLULAR LOCATION lines. Terms from this vocabulary are annotated manually to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries but  are automatically assigned to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation program.<br>Further information on these two different annotation methods is available at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45 and http://www.uniprot.org/program/automatic_annotation .<br>When a UniProtKB Subcellular Location term describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the term to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB Subcellular Location terms and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB Subcellular Location term is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/spsl2go .

Method for transferring manual annotations to an entry based on a curator's judgment of its similarity to a putative ortholog that has annotations that are supported with experimental evidence. Annotations are created when a curator judges that the sequence of a protein shows high similarity to another protein that has annotation(s) supported by experimental evidence (and therefore display one of the evidence codes EXP, IDA, IGI, IMP, IPI or IEP). Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO terms display the 'ISS' evidence code and include an accession for the protein from which the annotation was projected in the 'with' field (column 8). This field can contain either a UniProtKB accession or an IPI (International Protein Index) identifier. Only annotations with an experimental evidence code and which do not have the 'NOT' qualifier are transferred. Putative orthologs are chosen using information combined from a variety of complementary sources. Potential orthologs are initially identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST. Orthology relationships are then verified manually using a combination of resources including sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases such as Ensembl Compara, INPARANOID and OrthoMCL, as well as other specialised databases such as species-specific collections (e.g. HGNC's HCOP). In all cases curators check each alignment and use their experience to assess whether similarity is considered to be strong enough to infer that the two proteins have a common function so that they can confidently project an annotation. While there is no fixed cut-off point in percentage sequence similarity, generally proteins which have greater than 30% identity that covers greater than 80% of the length of both proteins are examined further. For mammalian proteins this cut-off tends to be higher, with an average of 80% identity over 90% of the length of both proteins. Strict orthologs are desirable but not essential. In general, when there is evidence of multiple paralogs for a single species, annotations using less specific GO terms are transferred to the paralogs, however, annotations using more specific GO terms may be transferred to the most similar paralog in each species, this decision is taken on a case by case basis and may be influenced by statements by researchers in the field. Further detailed information on this procedure, including how ISS annotations are made to protein isoforms, can be found at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/ISS_method.html.

## Operon structure as IGC evidence

 * id: [GO_REF:0000025](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/gorefs/goref-0000025.md)
 * year: 2007
 * authors: Michelle Gwinn, TIGR curators



Genes in prokaryotic organisms are often arranged in operons. Genes in an operon are all transcribed into one mRNA. Generally the genes in the operons code for proteins that all have related functions. For example, they may be the steps in a biochemical pathway, or they may be the subunits of a protein complex. Often the genes in operons shared between organisms are syntenic; that is, the same genes are in the same order in the operon in different species. When assessing sequence-comparison-based evidence during the process of manual annotation of a genome, it is often the case that some of the genes in the operon will have strong sequence-based evidence while others will have weak evidence. If seen alone, not in the presence of an operon, the weak evidence in question may not be sufficient to make a functional annotation. However, in the presence of an operon in which there is strong evidence for some of the genes, the very presence of the gene in the operon is a strong indication that the gene shares in the process carried out by the operon. If the putative function is one expected to exist for the process in question and particularly if that function has been observed in the same operon in another species, then the annotation should be made. This type of evidence is inferred from the context of the gene in an operon, and therefore the evidence code is IGC "inferred from genomic context."

A meeting focused on the biology of skeletal and smooth muscle has been held on 24-25 July 2007 at the University of Padua, Italy, as a collaboration with the GO consortium and CRIBI Biotechnology Center. The aims of this effort were to provide a comprehensive representation of muscle biology in the biological process and cellular component ontologies and to improve the organization of muscle-specific terms to better describe the current knowledge of biological mechanisms in muscle tissue. Thus, the collaboration brought together experts in several areas of muscle biology and physiology who carried out a thorough review of the existing GO muscle terms as these terms were largely created by non-muscle experts using older definitions. In particular, several areas are being addressed actively in current research: the biological processes of muscle contraction, muscle plasticity, muscle development, and muscle regeneration; and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and membrane delimited compartments. This work resulted in the addition of 159 new terms and in the modification of 57 terms to bring them in line with current usage. Funding for the meeting was provided by Italian Telethon Foundation.

This GO reference describes the criteria used in assigning the evidence codes of IDA (ECO:0000314), IEP (ECO:0000270), ISS (ECO:0000250), IGC (ECO_0000317), RCA (ECO:0000245) and IEA (ECO:0000501) to annotate gene products from PAMGO_MGG. Standard BLASTP from NCBI was used (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast) to iteratively search reciprocal best hits and thus identify orthologs between predicted proteins of Magnaporthe grisea and GO proteins from multiple organisms with published association to GO terms. The alignments were manually reviewed for those hits with e-value equal to zero and with 80% or better coverage of both query and subject sequences, and for those hits with e<=10^-20, pid >=35 and sequence coverage >=80%. Furthermore, experimental or reviewed data from literature and other sources were incorporated into the GO annotation. IDA was assigned to an annotation if normal function of its gene was determined through transfections into a cell line and overexpression. IEP was assigned to an annotation if according to microarray experiments, its gene was upregulated in a biological process and the fold change was equal to or bigger than 10, or if according to Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS), its gene was upregulated only in a certain biological process and the fold change was equal to or bigger than 10. ISS was assigned to an annotation if the entry at the With_column was experimentally characterized and the pairwise alignments were manually reviewed. IGC was assigned to an annotation if it based on comparison and analysis of gene location and structure, clustering of genes, and phylogenetic reconstruction of these genes. RCA was assigned to an annotation if it based on integrated computational analysis of whole genome microarray data, and matches to InterPro, pfam, and COG etc. IEA was assigned to an annotation if its function assignment based on computational work, and no manual review was done.

 * year: 2008
 * authors: Daniel Haft, JCVI



The JCVI is developing a collection of mixed-evidence annotation rules, under the working name BrainGrab/RuleBase (BGRB). A rule has two parts. The first is the set of conditions that must be met for the rule to fire. The second is the set actions to be taken for rules that have fired. BGRB rules are designed to serve as proxies for the annotators that create them. They have very high fidelity but may have low coverage. Types of evidence used in combination include HMM hits and BLAST matches, hits to neighboring genes, pathway reconstruction reports from the Genome Properties system, and species taxonomy. BLAST matches are described by a number of separate parameters for raw score, percent sequence identity, and coverage of total sequence length by the match region. These parameters are customized for each protein family in order to achieve high fidelity in automated annotation systems. The flexible syntax makes it possible to use existing protein family classifiers, such as Pfam and TIGRFAMs HMMs, in new ways. It is especially useful in assigning GO terms to proteins such as SelD (selenide, water dikinase) that have different roles in different contexts.

### Original Documentation Below

The goal of the GO Reference Genome Project, described in PMID 19578431, is to provide accurate, complete and consistent GO annotations for all genes in twelve model organism genomes.To this end, GO curators are annotating evolutionary trees from the PANTHER database with GO terms describing molecular function, biological process and cellular component. GO terms based on experimental data from the scientific literature are used to annotate ancestral genes in the phylogenetic tree by sequence similarity (ISS), and unannotated descendants of these ancestral genes are inferred to have inherited these same GO annotations by descent. The annotations are done using a tool called PAINT (Phylogenetic Annotation and INference Tool).

The Gene Ontology Consortium uses the IC (Inferred by Curator) evidence code when an annotation cannot be supported by any direct evidence, but can be inferred by GO annotations that have been annotated to the same gene/gene product identifier in conjunction with the curator's knowledge of biology (supporting GO annotations must not be IC-evidenced). In many cases an IC-evidenced annotation simply applies the same reference that was used in the supporting GO annotation.  The use of IC evidence code in an annotation with reference GO_REF:0000036 signifies a curator inferred the GO term based on evidence from multiple sources of evidence/GO annotations. The 'with/from' field in these annotations will therefore supply more than one GO identifier, obtained from the set of supporting GO annotations assigned to the same gene/gene product identifier which cite publicly-available references.

 * ext xref: FB:FBrf0254415



This describes a method for supplying a NOT-qualified, IKR-evidenced GO annotation to a gene product, when general sequence homology considerations would suggest a function or location, or a role in a biological process, but where a curator has determined that the absence of key sequence residues, known to be required for an expected activity or location, indicating the gene product is unlikely to be able to carry out the implied activity, involvement in a process or cellular component location. This reference should only be used used when an IKR-evidenced annotation is made based on curator judgement from manually reviewing the sequence of the gene product and where no publication can be found to support the curators conclusion. It is preferable to cite a peer-reviewed publication (such as a PubMed identifier) for IKR-evidenced annotations whenever possible. Curators will have carefully reviewed the sequence of the annotated protein, and established that the key residues known to be required for an expected activity or location are not present. Inclusion of an identifier in the 'with/from' field, that highlights to the user the lacking residues(e.g. an alignment, domain or rule identifier) is absolutely required when annotating to IKR with this GO_REF.

This describes TIGR curators' interpretation of a combination of evidence. Our internal software tools present us with a great deal of evidence based on domains, sequence similarities, signal sequences, paralogous proteins, etc. The curator interprets the body of evidence to make a decision about a GO assignment when an external reference is not available. The curator places one or more accessions that informed the decision in the "with" field.

GO terms from a source species are projected onto one or more target species based on gene orthology obtained from the Ensembl Compara system. One to one, one to many and many to many orthologies are used but annotations are only projected between orthologs that have at least a 40% peptide identity to each other. Only GO annotations with an evidence type of IDA, IEP, IGI, IMP or IPI are projected, no annotations with a 'NOT' qualifier are projected and annotations to the GO:0005515 protein binding term are not projected. Projected GO annotations using this technique will receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). The model organism database identifier of the annotation source will be indicated in the 'With' column of the GOA association file.

Transitive assignment of GO terms to a gene based on a curator's judgment of its match to a sequence model,such as a Pfam or InterPro entry, that has manually curated GO annotations, mappings to GO terms, or a description from which GO terms can be inferred. A statistical model of a sequence or group of sequences is used to make a prediction about the function of a protein or RNA. Annotations are created when a curator evaluates the results, using criteria that include excluding false positives and ensuring that the annotation is accurate for all matches. Statistical scores (such as e values and cutoff scores) and the functional specificity of the model may also be (but are not always) considered. Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO terms use the 'ISM' evidence code and include an accession for the model from which the annotation was projected in the 'with' field (column 8).

The editors version of the GO (gene_ontology_write.obo) contains additional metadata, including provenance of graph links. Every week, the GO pipeline executes a process which first removes all links tagged as "is_inferred". The reasoner then generates a list of inferred links which are automatically added to the ontology with the "is_inferred" tag set. The pipeline generates a report describing which links have changed as a part of this process.

 * year: 2013
 * authors: The GO Consortium



GO is intended to cover the full range of species, therefore GO terms are defined to be taxon neutral, avoiding reliance on taxon information for full definition of the given process, function, or component. For certain terms, however, there is obvious implicit taxon specificity, such that the term should only be used to categorize gene products from particular species. Taxon specificity of GO terms is captured using relationships such as "only_in_taxon" and "never_in_taxon". All taxon constraints are inherited by sub-types and parts of the GO term they are applied to. Taxon constraints are used to prevent inappropriate annotations from being made by curators as well as to identify pre-existing annotations that violate the taxon constraints. Errors in annotations are automatically detected by looking for inconsistencies between the taxonomic origin of the annotated gene products and the implicit taxon specificity of the GO terms. The inconsistencies are passed on to curators for correction, in some cases the constraints need to be tightened or relaxed or the structure of the ontology needs to be adjusted. The taxon constraints are further described in this publication: Deegan, Dimmer and Mungall. BMC Bionformatics (2010) Formalization of taxon-based constraints to detect inconsistencies in annotaiton and ontology development. (PMID:20973947).

## OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation by SEA-PHAGE biocurators

 * id: [GO_REF:0000100](https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/gorefs/goref-0000100.md)
 * year: 2014
 * authors: Ivan Erill, SEA-PHAGE biocurators



This GO reference describes the criteria used by biocurators of the SEA-PHAGE consortium for the annotation of predicted gene products from newly sequenced bacteriophage genomes in the SEA-PHAGE phagesdb.org and other databases and in the GenBank records periodically released to NCBI for these genomes. In particular, this GO reference describes the criteria used to assign evidence codes ISS, ISA, ISO, ISM, IGC and ND. To assign ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM evidence codes, SEA-PHAGE biocurators use a varied array of bioinformatics tools to establish homology and conservation of sequence and structure functional determinants with proteins from multiple organisms with published association to experimental GO terms and lacking NOT qualifiers. These proteins are referenced in the WITH field of the annotation using their xref database accession. The primary tools for homology search in ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM assignments are BLASTP and HHpred, using a maximum e-value of 10^-7 for BLASTP and a minimum probability of 0.9 for HHpred, and manual inspection of alignments in both cases. For ISS and ISA assignments, BLASTP alignments are required to have at least 75% coverage and 30% identity. For ISO assignments, orthology is further validated using reciprocal BLASTP with the identified hit. For HHpred results, ISS or ISM annotations are made only if the source for the original GO annotation explicitly defines a matched domain function, or if more than half of the domains of the query protein are identified in the matching protein. All ISS, ISA, ISO and ISM assignments entail the manual verification of the source for the GO term in the matching protein sequence and critical curator assessment of the likelihood of preservation of function, process or component in the context of bacteriophage biology. IGC codes are assigned on the basis of suggestive evidence for function based on synteny, as inferred from whole-genome comparative analyses of multiple bacteriophage genomes using primarily the Phamerator software platform, and with special emphasis on the bacteriophage virion structure and assembly genes. When extensive review of published literature on putative homologs reveals no experimental evidence of function, component or process for a particular gene product, it is assigned an ND evidence code and annotated to the root term for Cellular Component, Molecular Function and Biological Process. As part of the review process for assignment of ISS, ISA, ISO, IGC and ISM evidence codes, SEA-PHAGE curators are required to analyze the reference literature for identified matches and shall perform GO annotations with appropriate evidence codes if these were not available.

In detail, predicted (e.g. by AUGUSTUS, see doi:10.1186/1471-2105-7-62) or transferred (e.g. via RATT, see doi:10:1093/nar/gkg1268) gene models in the target genome are translated and processed by OrthoMCL 1.4 together with reference protein sequences to produce clusters of gene products derived from orthologous genes. For each cluster, GO terms are automatically transferred from source products to the target gene products if they are experimentally verified (IDA (ECO:0000314), IMP (ECO:0000315), IPI (ECO:0000353), IGI (ECO:0000316), (EXP ECO:0000269). They are tagged with the ISO evidence code and the "with/from" is populated with the source feature references (e.g. "GeneDB:LmjF.28.0960"). OrthoMCL runs are done using the parameterization suggested in the OrthoMCL algorithm document (blastall -F 'm S' -e 1e-5).

GO terms are manually assigned to each rule in UniRule. These rules are prepared manually by UniProt curators based on the annotations present in reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records that share sequence features, sequence similarity and taxonomy. The assigned GO terms are then transferred to all unreviewed UniProtKB/TrEMBL proteins that meet the conditions given in the UniRule rule. GO annotations using this technique receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA; ECO:0000501). These annotations are updated regularly by UniProt and are available for download on both the GO and GOA EBI ftp sites. To report an annotation error or inconsistency, or for further information, please contact the UniProt Automated Annotation team at automated_annotation@ebi.ac.uk. UniRule is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), and the Protein Information Resource at Georgetown University (PIR).

GO terms from a source species are projected onto one or more target species based on gene orthology obtained from Ensembl Compara. One-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many orthology relations and anntations are transferred between orthologs that have at least a 40% peptide identity to each other. Only GO annotations with evidence codes ECO:0000314 (IDA), ECO:0000270 (IEP), ECO:0000316 (IGI), ECO:0000315 (IMP), and ECO:0000353 (IPI), or their descendants, are transferred; annotations with a 'NOT' qualifier are not transferred, and neither are annotations to GO:0005515 (protein binding). Annotations that are transferred using this method receive the evidence code ECO:0000265 (sequence orthology evidence used in automatic assertion), which maps up to the GO Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA) evidence code.  The model organism database identifier of the annotation source will be indicated in the 'With' column of the GOA association file.

GO terms are automatically assigned based on inter-ontology links to generate inferred annotations. Annotations from Molecular Function to Biological Process can be propagated, as well as between Biological Process and Cellular Component. Annotations that are created using this inference method receive either the evidence code ECO:0000366 (evidence based on logical inference from automatic annotation used in automatic assertion) or ECO:0000364 (evidence based on logical inference from manual annotation used in automatic assertion), depending on whether the source annotation has a manual or automatic evidence code. Both of these codes map up to the GO Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA) evidence code.

Trypanosomes are exquisitely structured cells in which protein localisation can be extremely informative for likely function. TrypTag is a project using expression of N- and C-terminal mNeonGreen fusion proteins from the endogenous loci to determine the subcellular localisation of every gene in the Trypanosoma brucei genome. GO Cellular Component terms are manually assigned by curators studying fluorescence microscope images of the resulting cells labelled with mNeonGreen fusion proteins. As trypanosomes are a pathogenic basal eukaryote, this will indicate likely function of both highly conserved eukaryote genes and parasite-specific genes.

## Gene Ontology annotations Inferred by Curator (IC) using at least one Inferred by Sequence Similarity (ISS) annotation to support the inference

 * ext xref: FB:FBrf0233689



The Gene Ontology Consortium uses the IC (Inferred by Curator; ECO:0000305) evidence code when assignment of a GO term cannot be supported by direct experimental or sequence-based evidence, but can, based on a curator’s biological knowledge, be reasonably inferred from existing GO annotations to the same gene/gene product.  Use of the IC evidence code with GO_REF:0000111 indicates that a curator inferred the GO term based on at least one supporting annotation with an 'Inferred from Sequence Similarity' (ISS; ECO:0000250) evidence code.  Note that additional supporting annotations may be experimentally evidenced. When using GO_REF:0000111, the 'with/from' field must contain all GO identifiers used as supporting annotations.

## OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation by CACAO biocurators

 * authors: Ivan Erill, James Hu, Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies



This GO reference describes the criteria used by biocurators participating in the Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies (CACAO) to annotate gene products from genomes of interest through the use of computational methods to establish and manually validate function or homology to gene products. In particular, this GO reference describes the criteria used to make annotations based on evidence codes ISS, ISA, ISO, ISM and IGC. To perform ISS-, ISA-, and ISO-based annotations on a gene product, CACAO biocurators use sequence- and structure-based search algorithms (e.g. BLASTP, HHPred) to establish homology, conservation of sequence and structure functional determinants between the target gene product and gene products from other organisms with published GO annotations supported by experimental codes and lacking NOT qualifiers. These gene products are referenced in the WITH field of the annotation using their xref database accession. ISM-based annotations make use of published computational methods (e.g. TMHMM, SignalP) to predict gene product structure, localization or function. IGC-based annotations are made on the basis of suggestive evidence for function based on synteny. Parameters and criteria for use of all computational methods (e.g. e-value) are listed and versioned in the publicly available CACAO documentation (http://gowiki.tamu.edu/). Annotations made by CACAO biocurators are reviewed by CACAO team instructors before their release.

## Gene Ontology annotation of human sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors (DbTFs) based on the TFClass database

The TFClass (http://tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/index.jsf) database provides a comprehensive classification of mammalian DNA binding transcription factors (DbTFs) based on their DNA binding domains (DBDs) (PMID:29087517). TFClass classifies mammalian DbTFs by a five-level classification in which the four highest levels represent groups defined by structural and sequence similarities (superclass, class, family, subfamily, and genera) (more details at http://www.edgar-wingender.de/TFClass_schema.html). This classification is based on the combination of background knowledge of the molecular structural features of DBDs (PMID:9340487, PMID:23427989) and phylogenetic trees constructed via multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering of manually validated DBDs and/or full-length protein sequences retrieved from UniProt (PMID:23427989, PMID:23180794, PMID:23427989). 

The NTNU curation team has evaluated each family and assigned a molecular function annotation, GO:0000981 (DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific), and a cellular component annotation GO:0000790 (nuclear chromatin), as appropriate. The superclass/class/family or subfamily ID is specified in the "With/From" field. The annotations are supported by the evidence code ECO:0005556 (multiple sequence alignment evidence used in manual assertion).

## Manual transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to homologous complexes by curator judgment of sequence, composition and function similarity

 * authors: Birgit Meldal and Sandra Orchard (1). (1) European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom



Method for transferring manual annotations to an entry based on a curator's judgment of its similarity to a putative homolog that has annotations that are supported with experimental evidence. Annotations are created when a curator judges that the sequence, composition and function of a complex shows high similarity to another complex that has annotation(s) supported by experimental evidence (and therefore display one of the evidence codes ECO:0000353 [IPI] or ECO:0005543). Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO terms display the ECO:0005610, ECO:0005544 or ECO:0005546 evidence codes and include an accession for the complex from which the annotation was projected in the 'with/from' field (column 8). This field MUST contain a Complex Portal accession identifier. Putative homologs are chosen using information combined from a variety of complementary sources. Potential homologs are initially identified using sequence similarity search programs such as BLAST. Homologous relationships are then verified manually using a combination of resources including sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic and comparative genomics databases such as Ensembl Compara, INPARANOID and OrthoMCL, as well as other specialised databases such as species-specific collections (e.g. HGNC's HCOP). In all cases curators check the alignments for each complex component and use their experience to assess whether similarity is considered to be strong enough to infer that the two proteins have a common function so that they can confidently project an annotation. While there is no fixed cut-off point in percentage sequence similarity, generally proteins which have greater than 70% identity that covers greater than 90% of the length of both proteins are examined further. Whilst we expect subunit composition to be conserved between closely related species, this is not an absolute rule and orthologous complexes may differ if a subunit cannot be traced in one species or is experimentally shown not to be present. When there is evidence of multiple paralogs for a single species, multiple variants of the complex can be inferred.

Rfam (http://rfam.org, PMID:29112718) is a database of non-coding RNA families which are manually
annotated with GO terms by Rfam curators. RNAcentral (http://rnacentral.org, PMID:27794554) maintains
a comprehensive collection of non-coding RNA sequences that are regularly annotated with Rfam families
using the Infernal software (PMID:24008419). When a non-coding RNA sequence is matched to one or more Rfam families
by sequence similarity, the GO terms associated with the Rfam family are transitively assigned to the non-coding RNA sequence.
Annotations resulting from the transfer of GO terms are assigned the ECO:0000256 evidence code
(match to sequence model evidence used in automatic assertion) and include RNAcentral and Rfam accessions. 
The annotations are available on the GOA and EMBL-EBI FTP sites. 
The mapping between Rfam families and GO terms is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/rfam2go, 
and the Infernal software can be downloaded at http://eddylab.org/infernal. To report an annotation error or inconsistency,

## Electronic Gene Ontology annotations created by ARBA machine learning models

 * year: 2021
 * authors: UniProt



Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA) predicts Gene Ontology (GO) terms among other types of functional annotation such as Protein Description (DE), Keywords (KW), Enzyme Commission numbers (EC), subcellular LOcation (LO), etc. For all annotation types, reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records having manual annotations as reference data are used to perform the machine learning phase and generate prediction models. For GO terms, ARBA has an additional feature to augment reference data using the relations between GO terms in the GO graph. The data augmentation is based on adding more general annotations into records containing manual GO terms, which will result in richer reference data. The predicted GO terms are then propagated to all unreviewed UniProtKB/TrEMBL proteins that meet the conditions of ARBA models. GO annotations using this technique receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA; ECO:0000501).
