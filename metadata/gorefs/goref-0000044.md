## Gene Ontology annotation based on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Subcellular Location vocabulary mapping, accompanied by conservative changes to GO terms applied by UniProt. 

Transitive assignment of GO terms based on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Subcellular Location vocabulary. UniProtKB Subcellular Location is a controlled vocabulary used to supply subcellular location information to UniProtKB entries in the SUBCELLULAR LOCATION lines. Terms from this vocabulary are annotated manually to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries but are automatically assigned to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries from the underlying nucleic acid databases and/or by the UniProt automatic annotation program.<br>Further information on these two different annotation methods is available at https://www.uniprot.org/help/manual_curation and https://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic_annotation.<br>When a UniProtKB Subcellular Location term describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the term to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB Subcellular Location terms and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB Subcellular Location term is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/spsl2go.<br>Please note that the GO term in the annotation assigned with this GO reference has been changed from that originally applied by the UniProtKB Subcellular Location2GO mapping. This change has been carried out by the UniProt group to ensure the GO annotation obeys the GO Consortium’s ontology structure and taxonomic constraints. Further information on the methods used by UniProt to create IEA annotations is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/newto.
