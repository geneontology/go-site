## Gene Ontology annotation by the MGI curatorial staff, mouse gene nomenclature

For annotations documented via this citation, curators designed queries based on their knowledge of mouse gene nomenclature to group genes that shared common molecular functions, biological processes or cellular components. GO annotations were assigned to these genes in groups. Details of this strategy can be found in Hill et al., Genomics (2001) 74:121-128.
