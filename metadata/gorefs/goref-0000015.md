## Use of the ND evidence code for Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium created the evidence code "ND" to indicate "no biological data available". This code is used for annotations to any of the three terms 'molecular function; GO:0003674', 'biological process; GO:0008150' or 'cellular component; GO:0005575'. In GO member databases, the use of any of these three GO terms, attributed to this reference and supported by the ND evidence code, signifies that a curator has examined the available literature and/or sequence for this gene or protein and that as of the date of the annotation to the root term, there is no information supporting an annotation to any GO term in that ontology. (Note that ND can be used with any one (or two) of the 'root' terms, even if there is data available to support annotation to a term from one or both of the other ontologies; e.g., ND can be used with GO:0008372 if the function and process are known but component is not).
