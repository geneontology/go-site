## Use of the ND evidence code for Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
Direct annotations to any of the three root terms 'molecular function; GO:0003674', 'biological process; GO:0008150' or 'cellular component; GO:0005575' indicate that curators have found no data supporting an annotation to a more specific term, either in the literature and/or by sequence similarity for this gene or protein as of the date of the annotation.
