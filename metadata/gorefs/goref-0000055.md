## Gene Ontology Cellular Component annotation based on cellular fractionation.

Assignment of GO Cellular Component terms based on experimental evidence of cellular localization from Differential Detergent Fractionation (DDF). Cellular proteins are differentially fractionated and detected using mass spectrometry. Subcellular localization is based upon identification of proteins in different fractions and analysis of their predicted transmembrane domains. Proteins are assigned GO CC based upon a manually reviewed DDF2GO mapping file.
