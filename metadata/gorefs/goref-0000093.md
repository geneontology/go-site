## Representation for the degradation to or via a chemical as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the degradation of a chemical entity to or via an other chemical entity as biological processes. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0009056 and 'has input' some S and 'has output' some T" (catabolism to) and "GO:0009056 and 'has input' some S and 'has intermediate' some I" (catabolism via), where S,T, and I are chemical entities (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
