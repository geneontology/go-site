We have created a standard template for classes describing the transmembrane transporter activity a chemical entity (ChEBI) as molecular function. This includes variants for secondary active transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015291), uptake transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015563), and ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances (GO:0042626). The underlying equivalence axiom template is "G and 'transports or maintains localization of' some X",  where the genus G is either GO:0022857 (transmembrane transporter activity), GO:0015291, GO:0015563, or GO:0042626 depending on the variant. The variable X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
