## S. pombe keyword mapping

Active 2006-2012.

Keywords derived from manually curated primary annotation, e.g. gene product descriptions, are mapped to GO terms. Annotations made by this method have the evidence code Non-traceable Author Statement (NAS), and are filtered from the PomBase annotation files wherever another annotation exists that is equally or more specific, and supported by experimental or manually evaluated comparative evidence (such as ISS and its subtypes). Formerly GOC:pombekw2GO.
