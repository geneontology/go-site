## Representation of transport of a chemical into a cellular component as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the transport of a chemical entity (ChEBI) into a cellular component as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom template is "GO:0006810 and 'has_target_end_location' some T and 'imports' some S", where T is a cellular component and S is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
