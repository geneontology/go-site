## Representation of chemical homeostasis and cellular chemical homeostasisl as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the homeostasis and cellular homeostasis for a chemical entity (ChEBI) as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0048878 and 'regulates level of' some X" (homeostasis) and "GO:0055082 and 'regulates level of' some X" (cellular homeostasis), where X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
