## Representation of assembly or disassembly of a cell component as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the assembly or disassembly of a cellular component as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0022607 and 'results_in_assembly_of' some C" (assembly) and "GO:0022411 and 'results_in_disassembly_of' some C" (disassembly), where C is a cellular component.
