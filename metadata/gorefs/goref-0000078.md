## Representation for the transport or vesicle-mediated transport of a chemical from and/or to a cell component as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the transport or vesicle-mediated transport of a chemical entity (ChEBI) from and/or to a cellular component as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0006810 and 'transports or maintains localization of' some X [ and 'has_target_start_location' some F] [ and 'has_target_end_location' some T]" (transport) and "GO:0016192 and 'transports or maintains localization of' some X [ and 'has_target_start_location' some F] [ and 'has_target_end_location' some T]" (vesicle-mediated transport), where F and T are cellular components and X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
