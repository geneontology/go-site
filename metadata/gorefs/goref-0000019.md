## Automatic transfer of experimentally verified manual GO annotation data to orthologs using Ensembl Compara

GO terms from a source species are projected on to one or more target species based on gene orthology obtained from the Ensembl Compara system. Only one to one and apparent one to one orthologies are used for a restricted range of species. Only GO annotations with a manual experimental evidence type of IDA, IEP, IGI, IMP or IPI are projected. Projected GO annotations using this technique will receive the evidence code, inferred from electronic annotation, 'IEA'. The Ensembl protein identifier of the annotation source is indicated in the 'With' column of the GOA association file.
