## Gene Ontology annotation based on Enzyme Commission mapping.

Transitive assignment using Enzyme Commission identifiers. This method is used for any database entry, such as a protein record in UniProtKB or TrEMBL, that has had an Enzyme Commission number assigned. The corresponding GO term is determined using the EC cross-references in the GO molecular function ontology. Also see Hill et al., Genomics (2001) 74:121-128. The mapping file is available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/ec2go.
