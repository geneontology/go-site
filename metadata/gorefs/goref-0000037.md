## OBSOLETE Gene Ontology annotation based on manual assignment of UniProtKB keywords in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.

Transitive assignments using UniProtKB keywords. The UniProtKB keyword controlled vocabulary has been created and used by the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) to supply 10 different categories of information to UniProtKB entries. Further information on the UniProtKB keyword resource can be found at http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist. UniProtKB keywords are manually applied to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries by UniProt curators. Further information on the UniProtKB manual annotation process is available at http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45.<br>When a UniProtKB keyword describes a concept that is within the scope of the Gene Ontology, it is investigated to determine whether it is appropriate to map the keyword to an equivalent term in GO. The mapping between UniProtKB keywords and GO terms is carried out manually. Definitions and hierarchies of the terms in the two resources are compared and the mapping generated will reflect the most correct correspondence. The translation table between GO terms and UniProtKB keywords is maintained by the UniProt-GOA team and available at http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/uniprotkb_kw2go.
