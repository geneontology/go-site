## BLAST search criteria for ISS assignment in PAMGO_GAT

This GO reference describes the criteria used in assigning the evidence code of ISS via BLAST searches to annotate gene products from PAMGO_GAT. Standard BLASTP from NCBI was used (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast) to query the non-redundant (NR) database. Hits are considered to be significant if the E-value is at or less than 10^-4. All other parameters are default according to http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast.
