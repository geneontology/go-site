We have created a standard template for classes each describing the metabolism, catabolism, or biosynthesis of a chemical entity (ChEBI) as a process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0008152 and 'has participant' some X" (metabolism), "GO:0009056 and 'has input' some X" (catabolism), "GO:0009058 and 'has output' some X" and (biosynthesis),  where X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
