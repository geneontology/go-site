## OBSOLETE Automatic transfer of experimentally verified manual GO annotation data to plant orthologs using Ensembl Compara

GO terms from a source species are projected onto one or more target species based on gene orthology obtained from the Ensembl Compara system. One to one, one to many and many to many orthologies are used but annotations are only projected between orthologs that have at least a 40% peptide identity to each other. Only GO annotations with an evidence type of IDA, IEP, IGI, IMP or IPI are projected, no annotations with a 'NOT' qualifier are projected and annotations to the GO:0005515 protein binding term are not projected. Projected GO annotations using this technique will receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). The model organism database identifier of the annotation source will be indicated in the 'With' column of the GOA association file.
