## Automated transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to close orthologs.

Mouse Genome Database (MGD),  The HUGO Gene  Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and Rat Genome Database (RGD )have extensive procedures in place, overseen by expert curation, to establish orthology relationships between their genes.  MGI, RGD, and GO Annotation at EBI (UniProtKB-GOA) engage in curated Gene Ontology (GO) annotation using the experimental literature available for each organism and adhering rigorously to the guidelines set forth by the GOC. Therefore, Experimentally based   annotations (IDA, IMP IPI, IGI, and EXP) for orthologous Rat and Human genes are downloaded and assigned to mouse genes based on orthology, and given the ISO evidence code and an entry in the inferred_from field to indicate the orthologous object.
