## Automated transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to close orthologs.
Automated transfer of experimentally-verified manual GO annotation data to close orthologs.
Mouse Genome Database (MGD) and The Alliance of Genome Resources have extensive procedures in place to 
establish orthology relationships between genes. The experimentally-based annotations provided by 
model-organism groups (IDA, IMP IPI, IGI, and EXP) are used to provide annotations to the respective 
orthologs, and given the ISO evidence code and an entry in the inferred_from field to indicate the orthologous entity.
