## Electronic Gene Ontology annotations created by transferring manual GO annotations between related proteins based on shared sequence features.

GO terms are manually assigned to each rule in UniRule. These rules are prepared manually by UniProt curators based on the annotations present in reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records that share sequence features, sequence similarity and taxonomy. The assigned GO terms are then transferred to all unreviewed UniProtKB/TrEMBL proteins that meet the conditions given in the UniRule rule. GO annotations using this technique receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). These annotations are updated regularly by UniProt and are available for download on both the GO and GOA EBI ftp sites. To report an annotation error or inconsistency, or for further information, please contact the UniProt Automated Annotation team at automated_annotation@ebi.ac.uk. UniRule is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), and the Protein Information Resource at Georgetown University (PIR). For further information, please see UniProt: a hub for protein information Nucleic Acids Res. 2015, 43, D204, doi: 10.1093/nar/gku989 or www.uniprot.org.
