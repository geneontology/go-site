## Automatic assignment of GO terms using logical inference, based on on inter-ontology links.

GO terms are automatically assigned based on inter-ontology links to generate inferred annotations. Annotations from Molecular Function to Biological Process can be propagated, as well as between Biological Process and Cellular Component . Annotations that are created using this inference method receive either the evidence code ECO:0000366 (evidence based on logical inference from automatic annotation used in automatic assertion) or ECO:0000364 (evidence based on logical inference from manual annotation used in automatic assertion), depending on whether the source annotation has a manual or automatic evidence code. Both of these codes map up to the GO Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA) evidence code.
