## Automatic Gene Ontology annotation based on Rhea mapping.

Rhea (https://www.rhea-db.org/, PMID:30272209) is an expert-curated knowledgebase of chemical and transport reactions of biological interest - and the standard for enzyme and transporter annotation in UniProtKB (PMID:31688925). Rhea uses the chemical dictionary ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) to describe reaction participants and their chemical transformations in a computationally tractable manner. GO terms corresponding to Rhea reactions are assigned a Rhea database cross-reference. The corresponding GO term is automatically applied to all UniProt entries annotated with a Rhea reaction. The mapping file is available at: http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/external2go/rhea2go.
