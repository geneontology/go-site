## Representation of transmembrane transport of a chemical as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the transmembrane transport of a chemical entity (ChEBI) as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom template is "GO:0055085 and 'transports or maintains localization of' some X", where X is a chemical entity (CHEBI:24431). The approach to combine GO and ChEBI has been described in the following publication: PMID:23895341.
