## Gene Ontology annotation of human sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors (DbTFs) based on the TFClass database

TFClass (http://tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/index.jsf) is a database that provides a comprehensive classification of mammalian DbTFs based on their DNA binding domains (DBDs) (PMID:29087517). This database classifies mammalian DbTFs by a six-level classification in which the four highest levels represent groups defined by structural and sequence similarities (superclass, class, family, subfamily) and the two lower levels summarize physical entities such as genes (genus) and specific gene products (species, or molecular species) (more details at http://www.edgar-wingender.de/TFClass_schema.html). This classification is based on the combination of background knowledge of the molecular structural features of DBDs (PMID:9340487, PMID:23427989) and phylogenetic trees constructed via multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering of manually validated DBDs and/or full-lenght protein sequences retrieved from Uniprot (PMID:23427989, PMID:23180794, PMID:23427989). The NTNU curation team has assigned the molecular function term GO:0000981 (RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity, sequence-specific DNA binding) supported by the evidence code ECO:0005556 (multiple sequence alignment evidence used in manual assertion), which can be mapped back to the GO evidence code "inferred from sequence alignment" (ISA), to all human DbTFs extracted from the current version of TFClass (January 2018). Other proteins belonging to the same family (as defined by TFClass as shown above) associated with at least one GO annotation with GO:0000981 and its children or GO:0043565 and its children supported with any type of GO evidence code were added to the field "With/From".
