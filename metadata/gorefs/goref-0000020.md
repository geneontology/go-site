## Electronic Gene Ontology annotations created by transferring manual GO annotations between orthologous microbial proteins

GO terms are manually assigned to each HAMAP family rule. High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteins (HAMAP) family rules are a collection of orthologous microbial protein families, from bacteria, archaea and plastids, generated manually by expert curators. The assigned GO terms are then transferred to all the proteins that belong to each HAMAP family. Only GO terms from the molecular function and biological process ontologies are assigned. GO annotations using this technique will receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA). These annotations are updated monthly by HAMAP and are available for download on both GO and GOA EBI ftp sites. To report an annotation error or inconsistency, or for further information, please contact the GO Consortium at gohelp@genome.stanford.edu or submit a comment the SourceForge Annotation Issues tracker (http://sourceforge.net/projects/geneontology/). HAMAP is a project based at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Gattiker et al. 2003, Comp. Biol and Chem. 27: 49-58). For further information, please see http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap/.
