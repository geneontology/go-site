## Representation of transport of a cellular component as biological process in the Gene Ontology

We have created a standard template for classes describing the transport or vesicle-mediated transport of a cellular component as a biological process. The underlying equivalence axiom templates are "GO:0006810 and 'transports or maintains localization of' some C" (transport) and "GO:0016192 and 'transports or maintains localization of' some C" (vesicle-mediated transport), where C is a cellular component.
