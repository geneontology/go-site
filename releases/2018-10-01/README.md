## Notes


* Due to the enforcement of "no IEAs over a year old" (https://github.com/geneontology/go-site/blob/master/metadata/rules/gorule-0000029.md), the number of IEAs will be reduced when compared to previous releases.

## Errata

### Primary products

* Due to an upstream data hiccup, an older GAF version was loaded affecting IBA (PAINT) products (geneontology/helpdesk#112).

### Secondary products

* Due to an error in the loader ingest logic, PANTHER families did not appear in the Solr indicies (under investigation: https://github.com/geneontology/amigo/issues/532#issuecomment-426433147).
